  <h1>On Antisemitism &amp; Anti-Israeliness</h1><div><br></div><div><div><i>TL; DR</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>A core dynamic of antisemitism is one of bullying: pick an easy target.&nbsp;</i></div><div><i>Another is autoimmune disease.&nbsp;</i></div><div><i>Closely related is scapegoating: find someone convenient to blame.</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>Modern anti-Israel views are often related, largely because of a similar bullying dynamic.</i></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The Jews are unusual, and pretty unique, as they are a distributed ethnicity, as opposed to a local one. That is, they have not been primarily localized to a contiguous geographical area, but instead scattered in many disjoint locations. There are some analogies, such as overseas Chinese in Asia, or the Roma.&nbsp; Indeed, there are similar attitudes against the overseas Chinese, but their case differs in a number of ways. So do the Roma (1).</div><div><br></div><div>In any case, the Jews are the earliest extant instance of such a distributed group. As such, they form a minority everywhere they exist (prior to the establishment of Israel), and as such are vulnerable and suitable for bullying. They are also foreign in all these places, and so may elicit an immune response.</div><div><br></div><div>Being vulnerable is a necessary condition for attracting bullies, but it is not in itself sufficient. In addition, one must elicit envy; it is even better if there is something to be gained from the bullying, such as lunch money. The Jews fit the bill perfectly, because they tend to be successful (note that this is the same kind of statistical inference that underlies antisemitism and racism in general; that doesn't mean it isn't true). Thus Jews are vulnerable, elicit envy, and have property or cash that can be taxed in a discriminatory manner,&nbsp; looted during pogroms or confiscated outright. Since they are also people, they have inherent value as well: they can be enslaved, the women can be raped, and children can be taken and converted (and sometimes all three at once).</div><div><br></div><div>Historically, a major driver of European antisemitism was the Catholic church. The church did not blame the Romans for crucifying Jesus. They blamed the Jews. Never mind that Jesus was Jewish, and that it was the Romans that crucified him. The point being that the Romans were powerful and the Jews were not. This is the bullying dynamic.</div><div><br></div><div>Eventually the Romans co-opted Christianity (or vice versa), at which point blaming them is like blaming oneself, which any healthy mindset seeks to avoid as much as possible. One seeks to blame someone else, the other. That is the immune system dynamic.</div><div><br></div><div>Combining the two, it is best to blame someone who cannot defend themselves. This is scapegoating.</div><div><br></div><div>In modern Islamic antisemitism there is a disproportionate focus on Jews (as opposed to other infidels like Christians, Buddhists or Hindus) because they are a small group. Of course, the conflict with the Arabs aggravates this as well. There, the tendency to blame Jews for all the problems of the Arabs plays a major role.</div><div><br></div><div>As another example, one of the most famous anti-semitic works is <i>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i>. It was fabricated by Tsarist officials in the 19th century. It blames most of the world's problems on an organized Jewish conspiracy. Never mind that the conspiracy makes no sense even from the Jews' own perspective. The point is that it was formulated explicitly to direct blame. The Jews are the perfect scapegoat. Of course, the main market for the protocols and Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf</i> are in the Arab world because they desperately need to blame someone for their messed up societies.</div><div><br></div><div>While we are at it, Hitler gave one of the most lucid articulations of this logic in an interview in 1922:</div><div><br></div><div><i>It is manifestly clear and has been proven in practice and by the facts of all revolutions that a struggle for ideals, for improvements of any kind whatsoever, absolutely must be supplemented with a struggle against some social class or caste.</i></div><div><i>My object is to create first-rate revolutionary upheavals, regardless of what methods and means I have to use in the process. Earlier revolutions were directed either against the peasants, or the nobility and the clergy, or against dynasties and their network of vassals, but in no case has revolution succeeded without the presence of a lightning rod that could conduct and channel the odium of the general masses.</i></div><div><i>With this very thing in mind I scanned the revolutionary events of history and put the question to myself against which racial element in Germany can I unleash my propaganda of hate with the greatest prospects of success? I had to find the right kind of victim, and especially one against whom the struggle would make sense, materially speaking. I can assure you that I examined every possible and thinkable solution to this problem, and, weighing every imaginable factor, I came to the conclusion that a campaign against the Jews would be as popular as it would be successful.</i></div><div><i>There are few Germans who have not been vexed with the behavior of Jews or else have not suffered losses through them in some way or other. Disproportionately to their small number they account for an immense share of the German national wealth, which can just as easily be put to profitable use for the state and the general public as could the holdings of the monasteries, bishops, and nobility.</i></div><div><i>Once the hatred and the battle against the Jews have been really stirred up, their resistance will necessarily crumble in the shortest possible time. They are totally defenseless, and no one will stand up to protect them.</i></div><div><br></div><div>cited in <i><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520060227/hitler-and-the-final-solution">Fleming, Gerald. Hitler and the Final Solution<a/>. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984</i>, pages 28-29.</div><div><br></div><div>The logic is unassailable, and holds in almost every society where Jews are present in any significant numbers.</div><div><br></div><div>While western liberalism seeks to permanently root out such aberrations, it is evident that this is impossible as long as Jews are identifiable as a minority - that is, unless they disappear through assimilation. Today, even that might not suffice, as one can track ancestry thru DNA testing. Where the Nazis tracked people down through 3 generations (I believe the rule was 3 jewish grandparents), today we can track this down almost indefinitely, and the anti-semites of the near future will do exactly that.</div><div><br></div><div>In other words, anti-semitism is a chronic social illness, to be controlled, but never to be cured :-(.</div><div><br></div><div>But wait - this is the argument for Zionism. Since the enlightenment style arguments fail, we can attack the problem by establishing a Jewish majority state. By not being in the minority, both the immune response and bullying components are invalidated.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Alas, modern anti-Israeli sentiment shows that the problem is even worse. It is true that anti-semitism is not an issue in Israel. However, Israel itself is now subject to the same dynamic. Being a small country, it is vulnerable; being disproportionately successful - in war, espionage, agriculture, literature, music, science and technology - it elicits envy. Holding territory that its neighbors covet, there is something to be gained by eliminating it. And so we have, instead of a perfect scapegoat minority, a perfect scapegoat country.</div><div><br></div><div>Arab governments have used Israel to distract their populations from the problems caused by their corrupt and incompetent regimes at least from 1948 on.&nbsp; Anti-Israelis in the west are eager to blame everything from the oil embargoes of the 1970s thru 9/11 and ISIS on Israel; if only it wasn't there, the argument goes, the Arab world would be stable and friendly. There would be no terrorism, no unwanted migrants, no energy crises. Never mind that it is not the Israelis who hijack planes, engage in suicide bombings, attack the olympics, burn embassies over cartoons, or gas and carpet bomb arab people, resulting in orders of magnitude more deaths and refugees than the Israeli-Arab conflict ever has. The point is that one has to find someone convenient to blame.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>(1) It is worth noting why the cases of the overseas Chinese and Roma are different. The Chinese are of course backed by a very powerful native country. However much someone in Malaysia might resent the Chinese disproportionate success, if they decided to round up the Chinese in camps they might find that Malaysia would cease to be rather quickly. In short, the Chinese overseas may elicit an immune response, but they make a poor scapegoat.</div><div><br></div><div>The Roma on the other hand, have indeed been rounded up in camps and subjected to genocide, since they are vulnerable. They do not, however, elicit envy, since they are, for the most part, poor; and so they occupy far less attention.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>    <script>
